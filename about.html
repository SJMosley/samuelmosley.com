    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Born in Austin</p>
    <p>Husband and father of two amazing children. It is fascinating to watch the human mind learn and grow.</p>
    <p>"Ask More Questions" and "Better Every Day" are the primary mindsets I try to embody.</p>

    <h1>Hobbies/When I'm not at work</h1>
    
    <div class="hobby-section">
        <b>Pottery</b>
        <p>Starting in September 2021, my focus on deliberate practice pushed me to get better rapidly, quantity drives quality in ceramics. As a result, I have made many things I'm proud of and am now a teacher.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="hobby-section">
        <b>Reading</b>
        <p>I read a TON (less since kids). I love to hear what others are reading, give recommendations when they ask. In the first couple days of knowing you I will probably recommend Einsteins Dreams by Alan Lightman.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="hobby-section">
        <b>Programming</b>
        <p>Currently my programming is focused on Swift and Backend Developement. Previously I told myself and others I "wasn't a developer", despite that in every company I have worked at I have learned the programming language and committed code.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="hobby-section">
        <b>Rock Climbing</b>
        <p>I have been climbing 8 years. Teaching amany people to climb along the way. Climbing altered the course of my life and taught me to push myself, learn for enjoyment, and dig deeper in many other aspects of life. As a direct result of climbing, I have brought an experimental mindset to everything I do.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="hobby-section">
        <b>Mountain Biking</b>
        <p>As a beginner to mountain biking I rely heavily on my friends to teach me the ropes and it is extremely exciting to be a beginner again and have something completely new to learn about. Together we completed the Vapor Trail (150 Trail Miles) as my first bike-packing trip.</p>
